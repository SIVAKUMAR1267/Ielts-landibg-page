## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **React JS**: The project is built with React, leveraging a component-based architecture for a modular and maintainable codebase.
- **Tailwind CSS**: I chose Tailwind for styling due to its utility-first approach. This allowed me to rapidly build a responsive UI without writing custom CSS, leading to a lightweight and efficient final product.
- **Vite**: The project is set up using Vite for a fast and smooth development experience.

## üí° Design & Technical Choices

My main focus for this assignment was to demonstrate strong **design skills, responsiveness, and clean code**.

- **Modern and Professional Design**: I aimed for a clean aesthetic with a focus on readability and user experience. The color palette is calming and professional, and the layout uses generous spacing to avoid a cluttered feel.
- **Mobile-First Responsiveness**: I built the page with a mobile-first approach, using Tailwind's responsive utilities (`sm:`, `md:`, `lg:`) to ensure the layout gracefully adapts to smaller screens before scaling up for desktops.
- **Code Clarity**: By breaking the UI into individual React components (e.g., `Navbar.jsx`, `Hero.jsx`, `Testimonials.jsx`), I've created a structure that is easy to read, understand, and modify. This component-based approach is key to building scalable applications.
